== Dashed DOM_ID

Inspired by 
http://codefluency.com/articles/2006/05/30/rails-views-active-record-dom-ids/

== Introduction

The naming convention adopted is to split by - (dashes)
<classname>-<new or id>-<attribute>

i.e. 
     person.dom_id                  # gives 'person-3'
     person.dom_id('name')          # gives 'person-3-name'
     person.dom_id('name', 'dummy') # gives 'dummy-3-name'

This allows splitting by - to obtain 3 logical portions:
    person.dom_id('name').split(/-/) # ['person', '3', 'name']

The other convention is split by _ (underscores)
http://topfunky.net/svn/plugins/dom_id/

My POV is that _ could potentially conflict with long names, e.g. 
    senior_employee.dom_id('created_at') # senior_employee_45_created_at

With the _ convention, there is no convenient way to split that id into usable parts.
